# Shopicruit

## Task:

You've discovered the Shopify Store 'Shopicruit'. Since you're obsessed with lamps and wallets, you want to buy every single lamp and wallet variant they have to offer. By inspecting the Javascript calls on the store you discovered that the shop lists products at http://shopicruit.myshopify.com/products.json. Write a program that calculates how much all lamps and wallets would cost you. Attach your program (any language) and answer in your reply.
